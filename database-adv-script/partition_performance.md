Approach
Partitioning Strategy:
Table: Booking (from airbnb_schema.sql, artifact_id: 03de4876-c8f0-4208-9234-58308c841e3e).
Partition Key: start_date (DATE, NOT NULL), as it’s frequently used in range queries (e.g., WHERE start_date BETWEEN ... in performance.sql, artifact_id: 3bb4d1b6-1cd1-443e-a6bd-0a185a57f667).
Partition Type: Range partitioning by year on start_date, creating partitions for 2025, 2026, and a future catch-all partition (2027+). This is suitable for date-based queries and assumes a growing dataset over multiple years.
Database: I'll use PostgreSQL syntax, as it supports range partitioning natively. For MySQL, partitioning is similar but requires different syntax (noted below).
Implementation:
Drop and recreate the Booking table with partitioning, preserving the schema and constraints.
Move sample data from airbnb_seed.sql (artifact_id: 2d289b70-fba7-4728-9e8b-8ff37e4d6e2d) to the partitioned table.
Ensure indexes (e.g., idx_booking_user_id, idx_booking_property_id, idx_booking_created_at, idx_booking_status) are applied to partitions.
Performance Test:
Use a query from performance.sql that filters bookings by start_date (e.g., WHERE start_date BETWEEN '2025-07-01' AND '2025-07-31') to compare performance.
Run EXPLAIN (MySQL) or EXPLAIN ANALYZE (PostgreSQL) before and after partitioning to assess improvements.
Report: Include a brief report as a comment in the SQL file, summarizing partitioning benefits and performance observations.
Assumptions
The Booking table is large (e.g., millions of rows), making partitioning beneficial for range queries.
Sample data has 6 bookings in July 2025, so all data will fall into the 2025 partition, but the partitioning scheme will support future years.
PostgreSQL is used for native range partitioning. For MySQL, equivalent syntax is provided in comments.
Step 1: Partitioning the Booking Table
Drop Existing Table: Drop the Booking table and recreate it with partitions.
Partition Setup: Create a parent Booking table with no data, and child tables (booking_2025, booking_2026, booking_2027_future) for specific year ranges.
Constraints and Indexes: Apply primary key, foreign key, and check constraints to partitions, and recreate indexes from airbnb_schema.sql and database_index.sql (artifact_id: ffdaa54a-b12b-4aaf-a3d4-24ac39a69577).
Data Migration: Insert sample data into the partitioned table.
Step 2: Performance Test
Test Query: Use the refactored query from performance.sql with WHERE b.status = 'confirmed' AND b.start_date BETWEEN '2025-07-01' AND '2025-07-31'.
Before Partitioning: Run EXPLAIN on the non-partitioned table (assumed to be the current state).
After Partitioning: Run EXPLAIN on the partitioned table to show partition pruning (where only the 2025 partition is scanned).
Step 3: Report
The report will summarize the partitioning strategy, expected performance improvements (e.g., partition pruning reducing rows scanned), and observations from EXPLAIN.
SQL File
The partitioning.sql file will include:

Dropping the existing Booking table.
Creating the partitioned Booking table and child tables.
Recreating constraints and indexes.
Inserting sample data.
Performance analysis with EXPLAIN before and after.

Additional Notes
Partitioning Details:
PostgreSQL: Uses native range partitioning with PARTITION BY RANGE (start_date). Child tables (booking_2025, etc.) inherit the parent table’s structure, with constraints and indexes applied per partition.
MySQL: Requires including start_date in the primary key for range partitioning (PRIMARY KEY (booking_id, start_date)). The commented MySQL syntax is provided for reference.
Constraints: Foreign keys (property_id, user_id) and the check constraint (end_date >= start_date) are applied to each partition. The Payment table’s foreign key is dropped and recreated to accommodate the new table structure.
Indexes: Recreated for each partition (property_id, user_id, created_at, status) to maintain query performance for joins, filters, and sorting.
Performance Test:
Before Partitioning: EXPLAIN likely shows a Seq Scan on Booking for the start_date filter, as no index exists on start_date. The status filter uses idx_booking_status, and joins use idx_booking_user_id, idx_booking_property_id, and idx_payment_booking_id.
After Partitioning: EXPLAIN should show partition pruning, scanning only booking_2025 (6 rows in sample data). In a large dataset, this would reduce I/O by limiting the scan to one partition (e.g., 1 year’s data).
Sample Data: All 6 bookings are in 2025, so only booking_2025 is scanned. With larger data across multiple years, pruning would exclude irrelevant partitions, significantly improving performance.
Report Summary (included in file):
Partitioning by start_date enables partition pruning, reducing the number of rows scanned for date range queries.
The small sample data (6 bookings) shows minimal improvement, but in a production environment with millions of rows, pruning would limit scans to a single year’s partition, reducing query time.
Indexes on status and created_at ensure efficient filtering and sorting within partitions.
Execution:
Run after airbnb_schema.sql and airbnb_seed.sql (except for Booking inserts, which are included here).
For PostgreSQL, ensure uuid-ossp extension (CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp";).
For MySQL, use the commented syntax and ensure ENUM support.
Use EXPLAIN ANALYZE in PostgreSQL for runtime metrics; MySQL’s EXPLAIN shows the query plan.
Limitations:
The sample data is small, so performance gains are subtle. In production, partitioning shines with large datasets.
Partition maintenance (e.g., adding new partitions for future years) requires additional management.
MySQL partitioning requires start_date in the primary key, which may affect other queries.
