I'll address the objective by identifying high-usage columns in the User, Booking, and Property tables based on the queries provided in previous artifacts (e.g., airbnb_joins.sql, airbnb_subqueries.sql, airbnb_aggregation_window.sql) and creating appropriate indexes to optimize query performance. I'll also include SQL commands to measure query performance using EXPLAIN (for MySQL) or ANALYZE (for PostgreSQL) before and after adding the indexes. The output will be wrapped in an <xaiArtifact> tag as a single SQL file named database_index.sql.

Step 1: Identify High-Usage Columns
To identify high-usage columns, I'll analyze the queries from previous artifacts to find columns frequently used in WHERE, JOIN, GROUP BY, and ORDER BY clauses, as these are prime candidates for indexing to improve performance. The schema is defined in airbnb_schema.sql (artifact_id: 03de4876-c8f0-4208-9234-58308c841e3e), and sample data is from airbnb_seed.sql (artifact_id: 2d289b70-fba7-4728-9e8b-8ff37e4d6e2d).

Analysis of Queries
Joins Queries (airbnb_joins.sql):
INNER JOIN Query: Joins Booking and User on b.user_id = u.user_id, uses b.created_at in ORDER BY.
High-usage columns: Booking.user_id, User.user_id, Booking.created_at.
LEFT JOIN Query: Joins Property and Review on p.property_id = r.property_id, uses p.property_id and r.created_at in ORDER BY.
High-usage columns: Property.property_id, Review.property_id, Review.created_at.
FULL OUTER JOIN Query: Joins User and Booking on u.user_id = b.user_id, uses u.user_id and b.booking_id in ORDER BY.
High-usage columns: User.user_id, Booking.user_id, Booking.booking_id.
Subqueries (airbnb_subqueries.sql):
Non-correlated Subquery: Joins Property and a subquery on Review using p.property_id = r.property_id, groups Review by property_id, uses p.property_id in ORDER BY.
High-usage columns: Property.property_id, Review.property_id.
Correlated Subquery: Filters User where a subquery counts Booking records matching b.user_id = u.user_id.
High-usage columns: User.user_id, Booking.user_id.
Aggregation and Window Functions (airbnb_aggregation_window.sql):
Aggregation Query: Joins User and Booking on u.user_id = b.user_id, groups by u.user_id, u.first_name, u.last_name, u.email, orders by booking_count and u.user_id.
High-usage columns: User.user_id, Booking.user_id.
Window Function Query: Joins Property and Booking on p.property_id = b.property_id, groups by p.property_id, p.name, p.location, p.pricepernight, orders by booking_count and p.property_id.
High-usage columns: Property.property_id, Booking.property_id.
High-Usage Columns Summary
User Table:
user_id: Used in JOIN clauses (with Booking, Review, Message) and WHERE/GROUP BY in subqueries and aggregations.
email: Used in unique constraint and potentially in lookups (e.g., login queries, though not in provided queries).
Booking Table:
user_id: Used in JOIN clauses with User and in WHERE for subqueries.
property_id: Used in JOIN clauses with Property and in GROUP BY for aggregations.
booking_id: Used in ORDER BY and potentially in lookups (e.g., joining with Payment).
created_at: Used in ORDER BY for sorting bookings.
Property Table:
property_id: Used in JOIN clauses with Booking and Review, and in GROUP BY/ORDER BY for aggregations and subqueries.
host_id: Used in foreign key constraint and potentially in queries filtering by host (though not frequent in provided queries).
Existing Indexes
From airbnb_schema.sql, the following indexes already exist:

User: user_id (primary key, indexed), email (unique index via uk_user_email).
Booking: booking_id (primary key, indexed), property_id (index via idx_booking_property_id), user_id (index via idx_booking_user_id).
Property: property_id (primary key, indexed), host_id (index via idx_property_host_id).
Missing Indexes
Based on the query analysis, the following columns are high-usage but lack indexes:

Booking.created_at: Used in ORDER BY in the INNER JOIN query. An index could optimize sorting and filtering by date.
Review.created_at: Used in ORDER BY in the LEFT JOIN query. An index could improve sorting performance.
Review.property_id: Already indexed (idx_review_property_id), but confirming its necessity due to frequent joins and grouping.
Step 2: Create Indexes
I'll create indexes for Booking.created_at and Review.created_at to optimize the queries identified above. The existing indexes on user_id, property_id, booking_id, and host_id are sufficient for the joins and filters in the provided queries.

Step 3: Measure Query Performance
I'll include EXPLAIN (MySQL) or EXPLAIN ANALYZE (PostgreSQL) to analyze the performance of the INNER JOIN query (using Booking.created_at in ORDER BY) and the LEFT JOIN query (using Review.created_at in ORDER BY) before and after adding the indexes. This will demonstrate the impact of the new indexes.



-- Step 1: Analyze performance of INNER JOIN query before adding index on Booking.created_at
-- Query from airbnb_joins.sql
EXPLAIN
SELECT 
    b.booking_id,
    b.start_date,
    b.end_date,
    b.total_price,
    b.status,
    u.user_id,
    u.first_name,
    u.last_name,
    u.email
FROM Booking b
INNER JOIN User u ON b.user_id = u.user_id
ORDER BY b.created_at;

-- Step 2: Analyze performance of LEFT JOIN query before adding index on Review.created_at
-- Query from airbnb_joins.sql
EXPLAIN
SELECT 
    p.property_id,
    p.name AS property_name,
    p.location,
    p.pricepernight,
    r.review_id,
    r.rating,
    r.comment,
    r.created_at AS review_date
FROM Property p
LEFT JOIN Review r ON p.property_id = r.property_id
ORDER BY p.property_id, r.created_at;

-- Step 3: Create new indexes to optimize query performance
-- Index on Booking.created_at for ORDER BY in INNER JOIN query
CREATE INDEX idx_booking_created_at ON Booking(created_at);

-- Index on Review.created_at for ORDER BY in LEFT JOIN query
CREATE INDEX idx_review_created_at ON Review(created_at);

-- Step 4: Re-analyze performance of INNER JOIN query after adding index
EXPLAIN
SELECT 
    b.booking_id,
    b.start_date,
    b.end_date,
    b.total_price,
    b.status,
    u.user_id,
    u.first_name,
    u.last_name,
    u.email
FROM Booking b
INNER JOIN User u ON b.user_id = u.user_id
ORDER BY b.created_at;

-- Step 5: Re-analyze performance of LEFT JOIN query after adding index
EXPLAIN
SELECT 
    p.property_id,
    p.name AS property_name,
    p.location,
    p.pricepernight,
    r.review_id,
    r.rating,
    r.comment,
    r.created_at AS review_date
FROM Property p
LEFT JOIN Review r ON p.property_id = r.property_id
ORDER BY p.property_id, r.created_at;
